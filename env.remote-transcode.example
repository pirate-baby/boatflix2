REMOTE_TRANSCODE_HOST=macbook-pro.local

# SSH username on the remote host
REMOTE_TRANSCODE_USER=yourname

# Path to SSH private key (inside container)
# Mount your key at this path in docker-compose.yml
REMOTE_TRANSCODE_SSH_KEY=/app/data/.ssh/id_boatflix_transcode

# SSH port (default: 22)
REMOTE_TRANSCODE_PORT=22

# Working directory on remote host for temporary files
# Will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
REMOTE_TRANSCODE_WORK_DIR=/tmp/boatflix-transcode

# Example docker-compose.yml volume mount for SSH key:
#
# services:
#   manager:
#     volumes:
#       - ./data:/app/data
#       - ~/.ssh/id_boatflix_transcode:/app/data/.ssh/id_boatflix_transcode:ro
#
# Or copy the key to the data directory:
#   mkdir -p ./data/.ssh
#   cp ~/.ssh/id_boatflix_transcode ./data/.ssh/
#   chmod 600 ./data/.ssh/id_boatflix_transcode
